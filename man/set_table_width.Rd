\usage{
set_table_width(flextable)
}
\arguments{
\item{flextable}{A \code{flextable} object.}
}
\value{
The \code{flextable} adjusted to the desired width.
}
\description{
Sets the width of the table based on its desired width (\code{\link[flextable]{dim_pretty}})
and the max width the table can be based on the page size. The column widths
are adjusted as needed to fit the page.
}
\details{
The maximum width for a table to fit into a portrait page is 6.5in and the
maximum width for a table to fit into a landscape page is 9in.

The table will be given a width of \code{\link[flextable]{autofit}} unless it
exceeds 9in. In that case, the table columns are adjusted to fit the max width.
