\title{Generate Barplot of Linkage Rates by Acquisition Dates}
\usage{
linkage_rates_over_time_plot(
  data,
  link_indicator_var,
  acquisition_year_var,
  acquisition_month_var
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables present in the left dataset
of the linkage.}

\item{link_indicator_var}{A string of the name of a logical or binary
variable present in \code{data} that indicates whether a record linked or not.}

\item{acquisition_year_var}{A string of the name of the numeric variable in
\code{data} that represents the acquisition year.}

\item{acquisition_month_var}{A string of the name of the numeric variable in
\code{data} that represents the acquisition month.}
}
\value{
A barplot of linkage rates by acquisition date.
}
\description{
Generates a barplot of linkage rates by acquisition dates with the x-axis
laid out depending on the number of unique years present in \code{data}.
}
\details{
The x-axis will either be displayed in monthly, quarterly, biyearly or years
depending on the range of the acquisition dates provided.

In order for the plot to be output, there needs to be enough range in the acquisition
dates to produce at least five bars in the barplot.
